# Crop-Recommendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine-learning-based project designed to help farmers and agricultural experts determine the most suitable crops for a given region based on soil and environmental conditions. By utilizing a dataset containing parameters like soil quality, temperature, humidity, and pH, the project trains and evaluates multiple machine-learning models to provide accurate crop predictions. This system not only predicts crops but also evaluates model performance to select the most effective approach for this task.

The dataset used in the project is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and standardize features for consistent scaling. The target variable, representing crop labels, is encoded using a LabelEncoder, while the features are scaled using StandardScaler for better model efficiency. The data is split into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio to ensure robust evaluation.

Six machine-learning models were implemented and compared: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Classifier. These models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring consistency in validation accuracy and reducing the risk of overfitting. For each model, test accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores were calculated and visualized to enable a detailed comparison.

The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest test accuracy and reliable validation accuracy. Comparative plots of validation accuracy across folds, test accuracy bar charts, and confusion matrices highlight its superior performance compared to other models. The inclusion of these visualizations aids in understanding the decision-making process behind selecting Random Forest as the final model for crop recommendations.

This project is implemented in Python and uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, model training, and result visualization. Users can execute the script to preprocess the dataset, train models, and view detailed performance metrics, including validation accuracies, confusion matrices, and accuracy comparisons. The results are displayed graphically for ease of interpretation.

The system has been designed for scalability and future improvements, such as integrating real-time soil quality data, weather forecasts, or deploying the model as a web-based application for easier accessibility. This project showcases the power of machine learning in solving real-world agricultural challenges and provides a strong foundation for further enhancements in precision agriculture.
